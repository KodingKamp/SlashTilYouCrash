# STYC - Slash Til You Crash
<h2>Description</h2>
STYC is a text-based hack-and-slash adventure game created by two college students in the back yard shed of their shared home; WiFi is better out there!
<h2>Overview</h2>
STYC offers a wide variety of options ranging from playing the game to not playing the game. Gameplay entails encountering dangerous creatures (and hags) and slashing them into pieces; only to move onto the next encounter where you basically relive the last minute of your life, until you die. No really, you kill until your character gets killed, hense the title: Slash 'til You Crash! Each victory yields a small chance of looting healing potions that can be used during battle to regain blood lost.
